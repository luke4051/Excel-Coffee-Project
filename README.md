# **Coffee Sales Analysis using Excel**


## Background
With coffee standing as a staple beverage for countless people worldwide, I was intrigued to unravel the factors influencing consumer preferences and sales trends.  

## Questions I wanted to answer through my Excel dashboard were:

1. What are the most popular roast types by country?
2. Who are the top 5 coffee customers?

## My Analysis

1.

Using the roast type slicer, the light and medium roast coffee is dominant in the United states, with $13,806 and $12,179 of sales respectively. Ireland's customer base is balanced between dark and light roast demand, producing sales of $2,663 and $2,605, with medium roast lagging significantly behind at $1,428 in sales. Finally, United Kingdom has a very well-balanced sales distribution with dark, light, and medium roast coffee sales at $863, $943, and $993. Using these metrics, we can see that when marketing to United States and Ireland it would be beneficial focusing on the top performing roasts to generate more growth. United Kingdom can benefit from spreading their promotion across various roasts as all seem to perform similarly.

The top 5 customers for coffee all spend between $275 and $320. When breaking it down based on who has a loyalty card however, top customers are spending about $100 less with the loyalty card, however, the total sales with the loyalty card exceed those without. This indicates that the loyalty card discounts are providing overall value to the company as people are willing to buy more product for cheaper. Another significant takeaway is that the top customers for light and medium roast coffee spend $250 but for dark roast only $179, indicating lower overall popularity for the dark roast, particularly in the United States. With this data, companies can look to sell their light and medium roast coffees in more bulk as high end consumers are willing to buy lots of it.
